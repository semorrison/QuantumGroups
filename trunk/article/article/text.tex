In this paper, we describe a \MMA package for performing
computations in the representation theory of an arbitrary quantum
group $\uqg$. Subject to quite restrictive practical
limitations,\footnote{My code is inefficient, the algorithms are
slow, and the computations are difficult!} this package can
\begin{itemize}
\item Calculate dimensions of weight spaces and invariant spaces of
tensor products of arbitrary highest weight representations, using a
combinatorial model.
\item Produce matrices representing the action of the generators of the quantum group
$\uqg$ on an arbitrary highest weight representation.
\item Calculate bases for the invariants spaces inside tensor
products of representations, or bases for intertwining maps between
two such tensor products.
\item Calculate the action of the universal $R$-matrix on pairs of
representations.
\end{itemize}
As an application, we demonstrate the computation of
Reshetikhin-Turaev quantum knot invariants in many cases which have
not been previously calculated.

This paper is instructional, rather than expository; we give
examples of the usage of the package, but present no `new
mathematics'.
